2. Update [Algolia DocSearch configuration](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/api-platform.json)

```jsonc
{
  "index_name": "api-platform",
  "start_urls": [
    {
      "url": "https://api-platform.com/docs/(?P<version>.*?)/",
      "variables": {
        "version": [
          "master",
          "2.5",
          "2.4",
          "2.3",
          "2.2",
          "2.1"
        ]
      }
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}
```

3. Add the new version in [`constants.js`](https://github.com/api-platform/website/blob/master/constants.js)

```javascript
module.exports = Object.freeze({
  // ...
  versions: ['master', '2.4', '2.3', '2.2', '2.1'],
  currentVersion: '2.5',
  masterVersion: '2.6',
  // ...
});
```

## ü§ù Contributors features

You need to use a valid github token to retrieve the list of contributors.

1. Go to your [github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

2. Select scopes `public_repo`, `read:org` and `read:user`, generate the token and copy it.

3. Create a new `.env.local` file on the root of your local website project, and set your token as an environment variable named `GITHUB_KEY`.
