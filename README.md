# api-platform.com

This repository contains the source code and documentation powering [api-platform.com](https://api-platform.com/).

Single Page Application built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/api-platform/website.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/api-platform/website)


## Project structure

The project has been created from the [API Platform distribution folder](https://api-platform.com/docs/distribution/#installing-the-framework). All next.js application code is located in the "pwa" folder. The project is made with [the Next.js new app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).


## 🤝 Contributors features

You need to use a valid github token to retrieve the list of contributors.

1. Go to your [github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

2. Select scopes `public_repo`, `read:org` and `read:user`, generate the token and copy it.

3. If you use "pnpm dev" on the folder pwa to launch the project, add a new `.env.local` file on the root of pwa folder, and set your token as an environment variable named `GITHUB_KEY`. 


If you use docker, create a file "secret_github_key" at the root of the project with your token inside : 
```sh
# Create the secret_github_key file
echo "YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" > secret_github_key

```

> **❗Core team badges restriction**: You need to be a member of API Platform organization to retrieve API Platform teams. You can still locally launch the project, but the badges of the core team members will not appear.
