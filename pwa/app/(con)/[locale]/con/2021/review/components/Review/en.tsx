            Some of the best speakers from our ecosystem were on stage and
            shared their knowledge on 2 languages.

            A wide variety of topics were discussed and we hope you got
            inspiration to pursue building your web applications.

            We are proud to have served our community vegetarian (and
            nutritious) food.

            And we think you liked it as much as we did: all the booths were
            empty!
