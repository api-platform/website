# Build your next REST API with Symfony & API Platform

 API Platform is a Symfony add-on that helps you automate the creation and personalization of a REST API. In this talk, you'll learn how to get started with API Platform. From a Doctrine data model, we'll generate a full featured series of CRUD API endpoints to read & write your model. We'll also cover more advanced use cases such as search filters, serialization contexts, authentication & authorizations, custom API endpoints, and extension points
