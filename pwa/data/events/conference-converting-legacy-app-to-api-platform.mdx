# Converting a legacy app to API Platform

In this session, we are going to share our experiences and learnings migrating the backend part of a legacy Single Page Application to Symfony and API Platform. We’ll share the why and how of this journey and highlight how we turned the resulting application into an installable executable for easier distribution.
