# Opening Keynote - A deeper look into API Platform 3

A year ago we introduced API Platform 3 with its set of probable changes and new features.

Today, after 1 more year of work, we gather again and are ready to reveal all the new features that have been revised so far!

We will present to you all of our major changes, and relay along the discussions we had within the core team that led to them. In addition, we will show you how these improvements can further speed up the development of API related software.
