# How Laravel Cloud Uses FrankenPHP in Production

Laravel Cloud is a deployment platform built specifically to run Laravel applications with maximum efficiency and reliability. Its infrastructure is optimized at every layer to support Laravel workloads with a strong focus on performance, scalability, and developer experience.

This talk explores how FrankenPHP is used as part of the platform’s Octane runtime option. It covers the integration of FrankenPHP into a Kubernetes-based environment, the process of building and optimizing containers for Octane, and the approach to monitoring and debugging Laravel applications running on FrankenPHP in production.
