# Growing the PHP Core—One Test at a Time

Ever dreamt of becoming a PHP core contributor but felt overwhelmed by the prospect of creating RFCs, maintaining extensions, or writing C code? Worry no more! In this talk, you’ll discover how to make a meaningful impact on the PHP core by writing tests without the need to write C code.

Join me for an interactive session where I’ll live code a test on stage, demystifying the process and equipping you with essential testing techniques.
