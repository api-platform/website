# API Platform revolution

API Platform 3.2 is out but what’s new?

Let’s first discover our new documentation website that comes with a revolutionary way to test, discover and document API Platform functionalities. If you followed my work you may have noticed that I worked on using PHP in Webassembly. You may wonder why and you’ll finally get answers!
