# Real-time message handling and notifications with API Platform

To meet the current demands for responsiveness and scalability in web applications and APIs, we will explore how to build a modern architecture for message handling using API Platform, Symfony Messenger and Mercure. Our goal is to establish a robust workflow that enables message processing and real time user notifications.

We will demonstrate how to orchestrate these technologies to deliver a seamless and immediate user experience, while ensuring high availability and optimal performance. This talk will give you a good foundation to address some of today’s performance and responsiveness requirements.
