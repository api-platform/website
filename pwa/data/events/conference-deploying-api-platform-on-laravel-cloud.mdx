# Deploying API Platform on Laravel Cloud

Modern APIs demand speed, scalability, and simplicity without compromising on developer experience.

With its dedicated Laravel driver, API Platform brings its powerful suite of tools for building REST and GraphQL APIs directly into the Laravel ecosystem.

Combined with Laravel Cloud, a platform built from the ground up for taking the pain out of deploying, hosting and scaling Laravel applications, developers can now ship robust APIs faster than ever.
