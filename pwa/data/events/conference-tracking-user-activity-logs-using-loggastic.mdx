# Tracking user activity logs using Loggastic

Meet Loggastic: an Open Source library for easily tracking and storing user activity logs to Elasticsearch. Built on top of Symfony, Loggastic comes with the API Platform support. We will explore the library’s concepts and the different paths we took before arriving at our current approach.

You’ll learn how to integrate Loggastic into your application, adapt it to your needs, and discover how to scale it for large amounts of data.
