# Dilemmas and decisions. What we’ve learned designing the new Sylius API

Sylius and API Platform integration is the project that we started in early 2020. Since then, we were working hard designing, delivering and adjusting our new API.

We've learned a lot and during my presentation, I would like to share our findings.

You may expect answers to the following questions:

- What was the path that we've gone through?
- Why did we design our API this way?
- What were our heuristics and what did we achieve?
- How do design more complicated flows in API?
