# Evil Tech: How Devs Became Villains

Once upon a time, developers were the unsung heroes of our world. The stereotypical developer, with glasses perched on the nose and an innate talent for science, even inspired the alter egos of superheroes.

However, today, software engineers often find themselves under scrutiny for their roles in creating data-gathering apps, facial recognition software in CCTV systems, and the constant tracking of citizens through GPS, among other issues.

From being heroes to becoming modern-day Dr. Frankensteins, tech creators face an unenviable dilemma: to embrace malevolence or strive for heroism.

During this talk, we will delve deep into the complex relationship between technology and ethics, and explore how developers navigate the fine line between progress and principles.

This is our villain’s origin story, told with a touch of dark humor.
