# How API Platform 4.2 is Redefining API Development

API Platform 4.2 marks a major step forward, focusing on developer experience and performance. In this session, I’ll guide you through its most impactful new features, all demonstrated on a real-world Symfony application.

We’ll explore the powerful new Object Mapper, a Symfony component I created to reduce boilerplate, and dive into the high-performance Json Streamer component integration, which reduces memory consumption and improves your API’s time-to-first-byte (TTFB). You’ll also see how a revamped core—with improved resource metadata, powerful new filters, and an intuitive design-first approach—makes development faster and more robust.

This session goes beyond a feature list to offer a practical guide for building better, more efficient APIs.
