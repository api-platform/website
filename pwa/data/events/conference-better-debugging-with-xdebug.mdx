# Better Debugging with Xdebug

In this talk I explain how to use Xdebug to get more productive writing PHP code, focussing on the improvements in Xdebug 3.2 and 3.3, to make the debugging experience better and easier to set up.

Beyond that, this session also goes through a few complicated scenarios that are harder to debug, and shows solutions to these conundrums.
