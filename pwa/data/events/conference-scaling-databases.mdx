# Scaling Databases

Running your database server on one server is easy. But scaling it is complex as there are many different ways to do it and each one has their own shortcomings. Most literature does never explain the precise advantages and disadvantages of each approach:

- Tasks to do before scaling
- Scaling-Up as a simple first approach
- Multi-Master
- Read Replication
- Sharding
