# Consuming HTTP APIs in PHP the Right Way!

Server-to-server communication via HTTP requests should be straightforward, but it often presents unexpected challenges.

From understanding HTTP itself to mapping requests to your domain and ensuring an excellent Developer Experience (DX) when building an SDK, the process is far from simple. In this talk, we’ll explore these challenges and demonstrate how to overcome them using SOLID object-oriented practices.

Discover how to leverage tools like php-http/discovery, symfony/http-client, and tackle the infamous PSR-7 trauma. Join us for practical insights into effectively consuming HTTP APIs in PHP.
