# Developing an API without API Platform

Sure, API Platform is great, but have you ever tried developing an API without it? In this conference, I will show you how you can start from a Symfony application and, with a few dozen lines, mimic the top features of API Platform. I will show you how to start with a simple solution for your API needings.

As we will progress through the implementation and enrich our software, we will see and understand the interest in using API Platform, as it will move out of our codebase the boilerplate code and standardize the way of developing your APIs.
