# Decentralization, query APIs, and other myths

[![Ruben Verborgh  - Decentralization, query APIs, and other myths](https://img.youtube.com/vi/7MMzkJQ2N_s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MMzkJQ2N_s&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eQfYOEmuQNG8he3AeOeWaz8&index=25)

Decentralized Web apps will fundamentally change what Web APIs look like, because there will be multiple sources instead of one.

In this talk, I will explain **how we approach API ecosystem design for the publication and consumption of decentralized knowledge graphs on the Web**.

Iâ€™ll introduce the Solid initiative for personal data vault, and the challenges this brings for the future of the Web and its APIs.
