# Domain-driven design with API Platform 3

[![Mathias Arlaud and Robin Chalas - Domain-driven design with API Platform 3](https://img.youtube.com/vi/SSQal3Msi9g/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSQal3Msi9g&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eQfYOEmuQNG8he3AeOeWaz8&index=21)

At Les-Tilleuls.coop, we like to use **API Platform**. Mainly because it addresses a lot of questions about web API design, but also for its ease of use.
This simplicity, however, comes with a cost that is generally felt when you need to get out of the box.

Fact is that at Les-Tilleuls.coop we also enjoy working on applications **with strong business constraints**, and even more to get off the rails. And when appropriate, we do so based on the DDD principles.

Hexagonal message-oriented architecture, business logic decoupled from the infrastructure, â€¦ So many precepts that become prerequisites when it comes to putting the business at the center of our applications while ensuring **their good maintainability**.
