# Building schema-first event-driven architectures with AsyncAPI

[![Fran MÃ©ndez - Building schema-first event-driven architectures with AsyncAPI](https://img.youtube.com/vi/HeokavFSB2A/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeokavFSB2A&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eQfYOEmuQNG8he3AeOeWaz8&index=19)

In this talk, Fran will show you how to build **schema-first APIs** and **event-driven architectures** using the AsyncAPI specification and Glee.

At the end of the talk, you should have a clear understanding of **the benefits of schema-first development** and how it can make your code **more resilient and maintainable**.
