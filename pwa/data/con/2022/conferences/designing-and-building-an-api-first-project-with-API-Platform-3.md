# Designing and Building an API-first Project with API Platform 3

API Platform makes it easy to create powerful, fast, and standards-compliant web APIs. API Platform also contains all the tools you need to develop state-of-the-art web and mobile applications that use your APIs.

Version 3 of our favorite framework, which has just been released, is even easier to use and at the same time more customizable than previous versions.

During this 1-day workshop **with the creators of API Platform**, youâ€™ll learn how to:

- **create a new API Platform 3 project** or install API Platform in an existing Symfony app
- **leverage the main features** of the framework to build a REST (HATEOAS) web API
- plug your own domain and persistence layer with **state providers** and **state processors**
- add **validation**, **authentication**, and **authorization** to your API
- benefit from **RDF, JSON-LD, Hydra**, and the other web standards supported out of the box by API Platform
- **expose a GraphQL and a REST API at the same time**, without changing a single line of code
- use **API Platform Admin**, a powerful hypermedia client leveraging RDF and React Admin to build B2B apps
- use **API Platform Client Generator** to scaffold Next.js, Nuxt.js, or React Native apps
- **deploy your app in production** with Kubernetes or Docker Compose
