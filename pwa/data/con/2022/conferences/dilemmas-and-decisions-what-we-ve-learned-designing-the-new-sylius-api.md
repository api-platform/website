# Dilemmas and decisions. What we’ve learned designing the new Sylius API

[![Łukasz Chruściel - Dilemmas and decisions. What we’ve learned designing the new Sylius API](https://img.youtube.com/vi/88CKcwZJXmU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88CKcwZJXmU&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eQfYOEmuQNG8he3AeOeWaz8&index=18)

Sylius and API Platform integration is the project that we started in early 2020. Since then, we were working hard **designing, delivering and adjusting our new API**.

We've **learned a lot** and during my presentation, I would like to share our findings.

You may expect answers to the following questions:
- What was the path that we've gone through?
- Why did we design our API this way?
- What were our heuristics and what did we achieve?
- How do design more complicated flows in API?
