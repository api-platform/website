## About Jérôme

Jérôme discovered his passion for coding in high school and has been hooked ever since. Today, he works as a senior back-end developer at Les-Tilleuls.coop and actively contributes to PHP.

A **dedicated astronomy enthusiast**, Jérôme brought his two passions together by creating Kosmorro, a program for calculating ephemerides. When he’s not at his keyboard, you’ll likely find him stargazing through his telescope.
