## About Soyuka

A Full-Stack developer, Antoine has been **contributing to open source software for over fifteen years**. He is the author and maintainer of several JavaScript modules and a contributor to PHP frameworks like Symfony, Laravel, and API Platform.

When he's not fixing or riding his motorbike, or juggling on a unicycle, you'll probably find him coding, writing, taking care of his baby, or preparing a new talk featuring some **crazy computer science**!
