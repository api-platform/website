## About Clément

Clément has been a PHP developer for about ten years at [Les-Tilleuls.coop](https://les-tilleuls.coop/en), where he started as an intern in 2015 after studying history. Today, he is a CTO and trainer, **constantly enjoying learning new things** while guiding his colleagues or clients in discovering Symfony.

In his spare time, he is also an avid scuba diver.
