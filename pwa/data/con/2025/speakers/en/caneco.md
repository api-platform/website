## About Caneco

Full-Stack Developer at Medicare & Host of LaraconEU, Caneco pulls off the kind of power clean that makes both linters and lifters proud. 

As part of the team behind **LaraconEU – the annual gathering for developers who love Laravel**, he brings his creative touch to the community by making open source look as good as it feels to use – one logo at a time.
