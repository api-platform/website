## About Hubert

Hubert has been Tech Lead at SensioLabs since 2015. He loves learning **as much as sharing his knowledge**. Passionate about development, especially Symfony (of course), he secretly wishes he could grow a true geek’s beard… but his facial hair won’t cooperate.

Oh, and one last thing: his name is **Hubert (pronounced y.bɛʁ), not Uber**. So don’t expect him to deliver your lunch at noon.
