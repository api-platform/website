## About Mathieu

Mathieu has been a developer for almost 15 years and works with Symfony on a daily basis. Having explored nearly every version since 1.4, he’s followed the evolution of the PHP ecosystem closely — and **joined the Symfony Core Team in 2021**.

Deeply passionate about the community and its vibrant spirit, **he loves sharing his experience at conferences** like Forum PHP, SymfonyLive, SymfonyCon, and the API Platform Conference!
