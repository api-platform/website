## About Rob

Rob Landers is an Engineering Manager at FinDock, when not contributing to FrankenPHP or Dapr. Prior to that, he was a software engineer for over 20 years, with experience at Automattic, and over 10 startups (a long story involving a sail boat). 

Rob absolutely loves distributed systems and solving those problems with PHP.
