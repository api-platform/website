## About Kévin

Founder of Les-Tilleuls.coop, a French worker-owned cooperative, **Kévin specializes in designing critical web applications** — high-traffic, high-availability systems with strong interoperability.

An active open source contributor for over 20 years, he’s a core team member of the Symfony framework and the creator of API Platform, the Mercure.rocks and Vulcain.rocks protocols, and FrankenPHP.

Kévin is also **an international speaker**, published author, box player, and proud cat dad to George.

In a past life, he played in a punk band — and if you dig deep enough, you might still find a few of his music videos online.
