# How API Platform 4.2 is Redefining API Development (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

API Platform 4.2 marks a major step forward, focusing on developer experience and performance. In this session, I'll guide you through its most impactful new features, all demonstrated on a real-world Symfony application.

Weâ€™ll explore the powerful new **Object Mapper**, a Symfony component I created to reduce boilerplate, and dive into the high-performance **Json Streamer** component integration, which reduces memory consumption and improves your API's time-to-first-byte (TTFB). You'll also see how a revamped coreâ€”with improved **resource metadata**, powerful new **filters**, and an intuitive **design-first approach**â€”makes development faster and more robust.

This session goes beyond a feature list to offer a practical guide for building better, more efficient APIs.
