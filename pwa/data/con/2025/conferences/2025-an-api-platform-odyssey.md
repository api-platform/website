# 2025, an API Platform OdysseyÂ (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

I still remember working on a project that used a massive e-commerce Cloud Platform back in 2018. The array came back, and I loudly admitted, "what on earth does embedded mean?!". Nobody corrected me. Nobody even knew it was the HAL standard, or what HATEOAS meant.

Fast forward to now, and anybody who wants to create an API in REST should all be using HAL standards. The drawback is: do you roll your own, do you find a 3rd party library to do it?

Step forward API Platform. Because if you're going to code an API to HAL standards and do it quickly, **this is a revelation**.
