# Â¿Whatâ€™s That Tech? (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

**Think you know your tech stacks?** Join this light-hearted, live-coded Laravel + NativePHP session where the nostalgic "Whoâ€™s That PokÃ©mon?" is reimagined with tech stack logos. From guessing blurred Tailwinds to mistaking Kubernetes for a fidget spinner, itâ€™s part game, part demo, and full-on developer fun.

Expect fast-paced code, a playful UI, and a twist of API-powered interactivity.
