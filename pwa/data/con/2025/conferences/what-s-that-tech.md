# ¿What’s That Tech? (🇺🇸)

**Think you know your tech stacks?** Join this light-hearted, live-coded Laravel + NativePHP session where the nostalgic "Who’s That Pokémon?" is reimagined with tech stack logos. From guessing blurred Tailwinds to mistaking Kubernetes for a fidget spinner, it’s part game, part demo, and full-on developer fun.

Expect fast-paced code, a playful UI, and a twist of API-powered interactivity.
