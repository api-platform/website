# Scaling Databases (🇺🇸)

Running your database server on one server is easy. But scaling it is complex as **there are many different ways to do it and each one has their own shortcomings**. Most literature does never explain the precise advantages and disadvantages of each approach:

- Tasks to do before scaling
- Scaling-Up as a simple first approach
- Multi-Master
- Read Replication
- Sharding
