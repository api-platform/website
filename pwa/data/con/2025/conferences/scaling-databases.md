# Scaling Databases (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

Running your database server on one server is easy. But scaling it is complex as **there are many different ways to do it and each one has their own shortcomings**. Most literature does never explain the precise advantages and disadvantages of each approach:

   â€¢ Scaling-Up as a simple first approach
   â€¢ Multi-Master
   â€¢ Read Replication
   â€¢ Sharding
