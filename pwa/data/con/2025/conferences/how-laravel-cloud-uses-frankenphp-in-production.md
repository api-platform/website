# How Laravel Cloud Uses FrankenPHP in ProductionÂ (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

Laravel Cloud is a deployment platform built specifically to run Laravel applications **with maximum efficiency and reliability**. Its infrastructure is optimized at every layer to support Laravel workloads with a strong focus on performance, scalability, and developer experience.

This talk explores **how FrankenPHP is used as part of the platformâ€™s Octane runtime option**. It covers the integration of FrankenPHP into a Kubernetes-based environment, the process of building and optimizing containers for Octane, and the approach to monitoring and debugging Laravel applications running on FrankenPHP in production.
