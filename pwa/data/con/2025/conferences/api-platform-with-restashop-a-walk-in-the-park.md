# API Platform in PrestaShop, a walk in the park?Â (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

In PrestaShop 9 we developed **a new modern API build on the CQRS architecture** which is the base for our migration these recent years. 

To help us with this new technical feature we chose API Platform as the backbone, and we're gonna tell you how we went through this integration.
