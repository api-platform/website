# Opening Keynote: The future of API (Platform) architecture

[![KÃ©vin Dunglas - The future of API (Platform) architecture](https://img.youtube.com/vi/p7mHHfj7ZPQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7mHHfj7ZPQ&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eSo7-CAyiirYfhJe4h_Wxs4&index=2)

I started API Platform in 2014 as a tiny bundle for the Symfony framework. 7 years later, that tiny bundle has grown into a popular fully-fledged framework with a lot of features, server-side and client-side libraries and an awesome community.

The last 7 years has proven that API Platform design was the right one. Most apps are now API-driven, JavaScript is ubiquitous and the web of data powers most AI technologies and is the backbone of our modern societies.

What's next? **Let's dive into the architecture that will power API Platform for the next 7 years!**
