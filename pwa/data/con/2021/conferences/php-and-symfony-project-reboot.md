# Project “reboot” : Why PHP and Symfony are still into the game for any new project

[![Olivier Doucet - Why PHP and Symfony are still into the game](https://img.youtube.com/vi/aB6lKL_SvYQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB6lKL_SvYQ&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eSo7-CAyiirYfhJe4h_Wxs4&index=14)

In 2020 we faced an important challenge: **reboot a project from scratch** and think again the architecture and technologies chosen two years ago.

This talk explains **why we chose Symfony + API-Platform + Mercure** in order to build **a fast and scalable application**, easy to improve and maintain.
The objective was to recode 4 years of work in 6 months.

*Context: for the last couple of years, two in-house developers were in charge of developing an API entirely in NodeJS + GraphQL. NodeJS seemed a good choice at that…*
