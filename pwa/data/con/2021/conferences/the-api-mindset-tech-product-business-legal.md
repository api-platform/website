# The API mindset: tech, product, business and legal

[![Mehdi Medjaoui - The API mindset: tech, product, business and legal](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LHJuKAsL5cs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHJuKAsL5cs&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eSo7-CAyiirYfhJe4h_Wxs4&index=5)

APIs are not anymore only technical interfaces. They are product interfaces, company interfaces, people interfaces, legal interfaces. In this talk, Mehdi will share with you ideas and stories from:

- The creation of the first APIs in 1968 and what we can still learn from them today
- How APIs become product in the last 10 years enabling the success of great companies like Stripe, Twilio, Sendgrid, Segment etc...
- What to understand to build the next 10 years' APIs that will shape our programmable world.
