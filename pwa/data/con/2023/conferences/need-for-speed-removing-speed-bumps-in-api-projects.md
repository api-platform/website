# Need for Speed: Removing speed bumps in API Projects (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

No one wants their app to be slow! Yet, we all may end up with not optimal solutions that may slow down responses of API Platform-based applications. During this speech, together, we will discover **typical pitfalls and how to spot them** and address them. 

This presentation will focus on the application-level things we may change to improve our response times.
