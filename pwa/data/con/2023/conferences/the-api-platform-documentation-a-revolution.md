# API Platform revolution (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

API Platform 3.2 is out but what's new? 

Let's first discover **our new documentation website** that comes with a revolutionary way to test, discover and document API Platform functionalities. If you followed my work you may have noticed that I worked on using PHP in Webassembly. You may wonder why and **you'll finally get answers**!

After a good rant on my favorite acronym "RTFM", I'll showcase our next generation features and tease about **API Platform 4** which is scheduled for next year.
