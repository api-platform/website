# Developing an API without API Platform (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

Sure, API Platform is great, but have you ever tried developing an API without it? In this conference, I will show you how you can start from a Symfony application and, with a few dozen lines, mimic the top features of API Platform. I will show you how to start with a simple solution for your API needings.

As we will progress through the implementation and enrich our software, **we will see and understand the interest in using API Platform**, as it will move out of our codebase the boilerplate code and standardize the way of developing your APIs.
