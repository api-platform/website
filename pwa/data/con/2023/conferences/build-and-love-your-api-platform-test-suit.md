# Build & Love your API Platform Test Suit (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) 

APIs love automated test suites. Not only do they keep your production site working, a killer test suite can be a nitro boost for development - removing manual testing with quick, beautiful and readable user scenarios.

In this talk, weâ€™ll cover **the testing basics** + harnessing Foundryâ€™s power for crafting quick, reliable data that keeps each test in isolation. Then, weâ€™ll **dive into API Platformâ€™s arsenal of tools** and explore the sleek zenstruck/browser library to create tests that are both gorgeous and efficient. 

By the end, youâ€™ll be whipping up automated tests faster than you can open Postman or Swagger.
