# Opening keynote (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)


The API Platform community is constantly working to improve the framework's performance, developer experience, and ease of deployment in production.

For version 3.2, we've put together some exciting new features:
- New **application server** specially designed for API Platform
- Worker mode **that boosts API performance** like never before
- **6x faster** Docker builds
- Deploy your APIs - **even without Docker** - with unrivaled ease

Even better, all these innovations can also be used **without API Platform** and will benefit the rest of the PHP ecosystem (Symfony, Laravel...).

Let's kick off this edition of API Platform Con by discovering these long-awaited new features!
