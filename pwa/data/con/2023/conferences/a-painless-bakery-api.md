# A Painless Bakery API (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸)

In this delicious talk, chefs Marine and ValÃ©riane will open their kitchen and code editors to teach you how to have **a fully deployed API** and itâ€™s going to be easy as pie.

Want a sneak peak at the day recipe?

- First, add two cups of API Platform for the structure.
- Add some documentation to it by pouring generously some Bump.sh.
- Let it REST while the CI does all the kneading.
- Serve it to your clients and fine gourmets using Platform.sh.

Bon appÃ©tit !
