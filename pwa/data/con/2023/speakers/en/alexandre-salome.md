## About Alexandre

Alexandre started software development as a child hobby (20+ years ago). He never thought that this crazy thing could be a job, so he was happy to discover that you can get paid to produce code and bugs. Nowadays, Alexandre is an **engineering director, for Platform.sh**. 

When he’s not on a keyboard, Alexandre is on the mat, where he practices Aikido. If you meet him, you can congratulate him on his black belt, which he passed successfully in June.
