## About Valériane

Valériane discovered code at école 42 a few years ago. Since then, she has been a freelance web developer and CTO assistant, before shifting to DevRel. 

As Bump.sh Principal Developer Advocate, she is driven by a single obsession: **serve and share with the community**. She specialized in APIs a few years ago and that’s why you can often see her at API conferences, happy with her community.
