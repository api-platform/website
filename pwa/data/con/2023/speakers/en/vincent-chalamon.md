## About Vincent

Expert developer at Les-Tilleuls.coop, **Vincent is a core-team member of the API Platform framework** and has contributed to Symfony too, especially on the Security Component.

When he's not riding his bike, he's probably traveling the world with his backpack looking for a hosting-alternative solution!
