## About Matt

Matt Holt (BS & MS Computer Science, Brigham Young University) is a software engineer with **special expertise in TLS deployment and automation**. 

He is the designer and principal **author of the (Caddy web server)[https://caddyserver.com]** -- the first and only server to use HTTPS by default. Caddy is now considered the de-facto standard for server-side TLS at scale. Matt works on Caddy full-time through open source sponsorships from companies who rely on Caddy, such as Stripe, Framer, Mercedes-Benz, Les-Tilleuls.coop, and many more. 

When Matt isn't at the computer, he's spending time with his family (wife and four kids).
