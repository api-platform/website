## About Soyuka

Full-Stack developer, Antoine has been **contributing to Open Source software for more than a decade**.

Author and maintainer of JavaScript modules, he also contributes to Symfony and API Platform.

When he is not fixing or riding his motorbike, or juggling on a unicycle, he is probably coding, writing or preparing a new talk involving mad computer science!
