## About Boas

Boas is a software developer with over five years of experience. After obtaining his Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, he transitioned into software development and found his passion for backend technologies, particularly PHP, Symfony and API Platform at bitExpert.

He loves automating and optimizing processes, **writing clean code**, and performing software tests. As a detail-oriented person, he enjoys **solving problems** and making things run efficiently.

Boas's trip to Lille is funded by [BitExpert](https://www.bitexpert.de/de), the travel sponsor of the event: a huge thank you to them!
