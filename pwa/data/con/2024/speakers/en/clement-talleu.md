## About Clément

Clément has been a PHP developer for about ten years at Les-Tilleuls.coop, where he started as an intern in 2015 after studying history.

Today, he is a lead developer and trainer, constantly **enjoying learning new things** while guiding his colleagues or clients in discovering Symfony.

In his spare time, he is also an avid scuba diver.
