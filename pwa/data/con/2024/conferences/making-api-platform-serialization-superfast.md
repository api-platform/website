# Making API Platform serialization superfast (🇺🇸) 

Serialization plays **an essential role** in any web application, particularly in the context of APIs, as it is one of the pivots of the HTTP request/response cycle.

Needs are evolving, and since its creation, the Serializer has confronted new issues. Its ability to handle large volumes of data while remaining efficient and flexible has become critical. And because API Platform relies a lot on that component, Serializer's limits are kind of API Platform's.

But **new tools have appeared over the years**, each enabling an independent improvement of a part of the Serializer component.

What are these tools? And how can they be orchestrated and integrated to API Platform to make it amazingly fast?
That's what we'll be talking about at this conference.
