# API Platform Admin: The Ultimate Admin Generator (🇺🇸) 

API Platform comes with a powerful admin generator, now based on react-admin v5. **Building admin or B2B UIs for your API has never been easier**, thanks to guessers, TypeScript validation, and a very large library of widgets. It's as if HTML had been extended with new components for filters, menus, user preferences, etc. 

Even if you're allergic to JS, API Platform Admin will dramatically **boost your productivity**.
