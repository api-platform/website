# Processing One Billion Rows in PHP (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) 

The 1brc is "a fun exploration of how quickly 1B rows from a text file can be aggregated with Java", but let's face it, we should be able to do this in PHP too, right? 

Join me and let's see how fast we can actually aggregate 1B rows in PHP and learn about **optimising the performance of PHP** software along the way.
