# Better Debugging with Xdebug (🇬🇧) 

In this talk I explain how to use Xdebug to **get more productive writing PHP code**, focussing on the improvements in Xdebug 3.2 and 3.3, to make
the debugging experience better and easier to set up.

Beyond that, this session also goes through a few complicated scenarios that are harder to debug, and shows solutions to these conundrums.
