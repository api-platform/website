          API Platform is built on top of <strong>battle-tested products</strong>.
          The server skeleton includes the famous <strong>Symfony 4</strong> microframework
          and the <strong>Doctrine</strong> ORM.
          Client-side components use Facebook&apos;s <strong>React</strong>
          (a Vue.js integration is also available).
          The development environment and the deployment mechanism leverage
          <strong>Docker, Kubernetes and Helm</strong>.

          API Platform is also designed as a set of independent and reusable
          components. You can perfectly use them in a standalone way, or integrate them by yourself
          in your own project.
