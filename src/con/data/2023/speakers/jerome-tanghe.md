## About Jérôme

Jérôme started developing in high school, and he quickly became passionate about code. Today he works as a senior back-end developer at Les-Tilleuls.coop, and he's an active contributor to API Platform.

Jérôme is also a **big fan of astronomy**, and he combined his two passions by creating **Kosmorro**, a program to calculate ephemerides. If you can't find him in front of his computer, he's probably outside looking through his telescope.
