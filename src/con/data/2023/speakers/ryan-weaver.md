## About Ryan

Ryan is a member of the **Symfony core team**, lead of Symfony UX & **tutorial writer** for SymfonyCasts. When it comes to code, he’s all about developer experience: how can we get great tools into the hands of more people… and hopefully make it really fun along the way. 

He spends a lot of his time hanging out with his much-more-talented wife Leanna and much-better-looking son Beckett.
