# All you need to know about securing your API (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸) 

Security concerns arise early when starting a new project, and changing that aspect later is far from trivial. Should I use good old sessions or API tokens ? Which kind of tokens? How long should they live? Refreshed or blocklisted? And what about Authorization? Do I need OAuth? Which flow? Shall I use Roles or Voters? Maybe both? Also, how can I scope resources to the authenticated user? 

This talk will give you the keys to determine **how to secure each part of *your* API within API Platform**, according to their business rules and the state-of-the-art.
