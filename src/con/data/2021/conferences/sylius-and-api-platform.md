# Sylius and API Platform. The story of integration

[![Łukasz Chruściel - Sylius & API Platform: the story of integration](https://img.youtube.com/vi/5f2qoBH7tl8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f2qoBH7tl8&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eSo7-CAyiirYfhJe4h_Wxs4&index=6)

Being a part of the Symfony ecosystem gives access to **the vast number of open-source solutions built on top**. A lot of people voluntarily committed the time to make impressive, multipurpose solutions. One of these solutions is the API Platform, the most mature framework for API development.

In Sylius, **it was always our goal to take advantage of the best of the breed and integrate with others**. Keeping this in mind, we have decided to combine both projects and deliver **a new quality in the headless e-commerce world**.

**How did it go to integrate new infrastructure** to the existing, pretty big codebase? **What were the main challenges that we encountered**, and how did we solve them? **What are the key take-outs from our integrations**? I will answer these and a few more questions during my talk.
