# Secure and Practical Authentication in API Platform

[![Robin Chalas - Secure and Practical Authentication in API Platform](https://img.youtube.com/vi/iISeDdwN5lY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iISeDdwN5lY&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eSo7-CAyiirYfhJe4h_Wxs4&index=15)

The Security part of your API is not something that belongs to API Platform itself.
Instead, the framework lets you rely on the Symfony Security integration, including Symfony's built-in authenticators and community bundles that build on top of it.

Stateful VS stateless, Cookies VS Headers, Standard protocols VS home-made authentication flows...
There's a lot of alternatives, which can make it very hard to find the right one.

In this talk we will review all these possibilities to see **how you should secure your API depending on your application and infrastructure**. Last but not least, we will discover a novelty that will help solving this issue.
