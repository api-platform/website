# French tech & Start up Nation, what else?

[![Hélène Maître-Marchois - French tech & Start up Nation, what else?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/XpY7p062zIo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpY7p062zIo&list=PL3hoUDjLa7eSo7-CAyiirYfhJe4h_Wxs4&index=16)

This is a little ethico-practical questioning on **the future of digital technology**. I'd like to talk about the questions that are bothering me about our responsibility but also our capacity to act on the tools and services we create every day.

What if, **together**, we had more power than it seems?
