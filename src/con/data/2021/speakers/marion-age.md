## About Marion

Marion is CTO at Les-Tilleuls.coop since 2012. She **designs and builds complete applications, in particular thanks to API Platform and Vue.js**, for e-commerce or for some small to large businesses where her challenge is to find **the best solution** to meet specific business needs using technology.

If you don't see her in front of her laptop, she's probably exploring the Occitania region on her gravel bike.
