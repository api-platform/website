## About Matt
​
Matt Holt (BS & MS Computer Science, Brigham Young University) is a software engineer with special expertise in TLS deployment and automation. He is the designer and principal author of the [Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com) -- the first and only server to use HTTPS by default. Caddy is now considered the de-facto standard for server-side TLS at scale.

When Matt's not coding with his bare hands, you can find him rock climbing.
