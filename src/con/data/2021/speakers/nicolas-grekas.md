## About Nicolas

Nicolas works nowadays on Symfony, with two sides to his contributions.

On the open-source side, he's been submitting new features and bug fixes almost daily for 7 years. He **puts a lot of efforts on making Symfony fast, smooth and extensible**, without compromising.

On the business side, he leads the ambition to create a sustainable company supporting and supported directly by the Symfony ecosystem.
