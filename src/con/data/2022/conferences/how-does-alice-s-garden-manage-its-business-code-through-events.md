# How does Alice's Garden manage its business code through events?

For a few years now, there has been a lot of talks about DDD and more particularly about the isolation of business code from the code concerned with infrastructure or dependencies.

Alice's Garden has business issues and not only technological ones. Large code overhauls are not possible (especially since in a small team), that's why, in the development department, we try to **maintain quality code** and in order to keep the code upgradable to facilitate the tests writing

In this talk, we will explain how the code has been cut via **a custom business event propagation management**.
