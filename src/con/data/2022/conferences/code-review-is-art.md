# Code review is Art !

Software delivery is professionalized and industrialized, we have automated many things and even if there are many tools to know that the code you produce is reliable and meets the specifications, it is difficult to ensure that it respects your standards (simple, robust, architecture and coding guidelines, performance issue, test coverage, handle edge cases...)

To check these aspects there is the code review, it is **the last human intervention before merging your code** and deploying, this therefore an important part of the delivery process and in the life of a project.
Beyond the code introspection it is a great moment of exchange.

Let's see together **how to make it easy** and take benefit from this step.
