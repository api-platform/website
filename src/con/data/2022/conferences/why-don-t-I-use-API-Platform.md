# Why don't I use API Platform?

When Kevin Dunglas asked me if I wanted to give a talk at API Platform Conference, I told him "I don't use API Platform". But that's true, **why don't I use it?**

In this talk, it will be an opportunity to look at API Platform **from a new perspective**, because to prepare for it, I had to look more into these reasons. Is the concern justified? Isn't it too late to ask this question?

The answer to this big question might surprise you ... or not.
