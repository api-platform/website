# 4 years later: The "Components Web App" (CWA)

In January 2018, with the news of Nuxt.js being in development to introduce SSR to Vue.js, I had an idea; could I create **a single data structure** to represent any website, that would allow websites to be built quickly and easily using **modular re-usable components**, while providing an extendable and easy to use admin area for the end-user?

Having created websites using Symfony and looking at what API Platform offers – it was the perfect starting block and has enabled us to create the best possible API.

The Components Web App aims to provide **a system to build decoupled, API driven websites with reusable components** in an easy and cost-effective way.

I will demonstrate the CWA live and give attendees the opportunity to discuss the features, ask questions and shape how we continue to develop the project. A live demo? What could possibly go wrong…
