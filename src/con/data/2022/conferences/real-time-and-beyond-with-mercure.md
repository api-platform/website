# Realtime and beyond with Mercure

Mercure is a modern protocol for delivering information to your applications in Realtime, natively supported in Browsers and Mobile devices.

We’ll use a real world case study to see how Raven Controls uses Mercure to **deliver information in realtime** at the world’s biggest events including Euro 2020 and COP26.

See how you can further enhance your application by capturing missed events using Mercure’s pub/sub system, update server side rendered apps in realtime, tips for running in production at scale and more.
