# APIs, the next 10 years : Beyond the Interface

APIs are the interfaces to connect software systems together.

Those who stay at this definition are staying too close to the interface. APIs have created a new mindset in the digital world. On the **economical side**, on the **technical side** and on the **societal side**.

APIs created new platform models, new ecosystem orchestration models, new open standards, new tools, new architecture patterns, new design styles that are reshaping completely how we think value in the digital space.

Taking concrete examples, Mehdi will share with you an anticipation of **what will happen in the next 10 years thanks to the API mindset beyond the interface**.
