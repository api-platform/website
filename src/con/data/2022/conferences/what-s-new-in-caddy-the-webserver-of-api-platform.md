# What's New in Caddy, the webserver of API Platform

Caddy is a general purpose web server with a focus on ease of use and secure defaults. It powers API Platform's default distribution, and streamlines the amount of pieces by bundling Mercure and Vulcain as plugins.

Since Matt Holt's talk at last year's API Platform conference, the project has made **many improvements**, some of which may be useful to solve some of your creative business ideas, and help you scale up.

**Learn about the new dynamic upstreams feature**, improvements to CEL matching, the new forward auth functionality, and more.
