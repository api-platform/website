# My fight against arachnophobia

Have you ever been hesitant to start a contribution for a project like API Platform or Symfony, and finally abandoned it because you felt like a fraud? **You're not alone!**

In this conference, I will show you that contributing to such projects is actually much easier than you think, and even possible for everyone. I will present my very first contribution to API Platform: an easter egg addition, and I will provide some advice to have all the chances to get your first contribution in your favorite framework's codebase.
