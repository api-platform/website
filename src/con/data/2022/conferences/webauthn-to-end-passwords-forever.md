# WebAuthn â€“ To end passwords. Forever

**Passwords are a real problem** for all web applications. As the PHP ecosystem evolves to prevent authentication failures, so do the threats.

How can we secure APIs and applications **to prevent security issues**? Thanks to WebAuthn, we are now able to get rid of passwords. With a simple user interaction, such as looking at a screen or touching a fingerprint reader, we can defeat most of those threats.

We will see how to implement such a modern authentication method and see how easy the backend and frontend integrations are.
