# Revenues transparency
API Platform Con is financed by only two sources of revenues: [ticketing](#pricing) and [sales of sponsor packages](#partners) to tech companies in exchange for visibility.

Also, by organizing this event, we wanted to be **financially accessible for everyone**. For instance, online tickets (English-speaking track) are **free for students and unemployed developers**. However, making this day has various costs:

- **Conference rooms rentals** and hiring of audiovisual professionals.
- **Speakers’ travel** accommodation.
- **Catering**: orders of morning, lunch and afternoon coffee breaks and buffets.
- **Communication & marketing**: graphic design, printing of rollups, badges and goodies, web advertising.


\
&nbsp;

If profits are made from this event, **they will be donated to the development of the [API Platform project](/)**.
