## About Kévin

After studies in web development, Kevin landed at SensioLabs to grow up from a newbie in Symfony and web development in general, to tech lead at PerfectDraft in less than 6 years.

He's working on a multi company WMS platform, allowing hundreds of users to **improve their productivity and well-being**.

Clean code, open source, keyboard shortcuts, developing useless websites in his free time and drinking too much beer are his everyday habits and motivations.
