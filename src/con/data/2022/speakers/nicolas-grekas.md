## About Nicolas

Nicolas works nowadays on Symfony, with two sides to his contributions.

As a member of the core team, he helps by helping others to contribute, by reviewing pull requests, by fixing bugs or by modernizing the code base. He **puts a lot of efforts on making Symfony fast, smooth and extensible**, without compromising.

On the business side, he leads the ambition to create a sustainable company supporting and supported directly by the Symfony ecosystem.
