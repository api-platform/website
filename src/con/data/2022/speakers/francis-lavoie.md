## About Francis

While completing his degree in **Computer Science** with a minor in Linguistics, Francis started his career as a PHP developer.

He discovered **Caddy** in 2017, when trying to solve deployment of his company's software, then gradually got more involved over the following years.

Now, a top contributor to the project, he spends much of his free time improving Caddy and **answering community questions**.
