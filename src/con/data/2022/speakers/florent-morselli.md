## About Florent

Self-taught Web Developer passionate about the PHP ecosystem.

My main activities are not related to the IT. However, I contribute as much as possible to open-source projects.

Also, I support other projects or publish my own work, mainly related to **Web Security such as TOTP, JWT, OAuth2 and Webauthn**.
