## About Jérémy

Several years of self-training in software development gave him a taste for doing things in a coherent, organized and efficient way.

Specialized in **software architectures, good development practices and software quality**, he has led several methodology changes in companies and implemented restructuring of important projects in a progressive and team-oriented way.

As a developer, he is mainly involved in backend layers, high volume processing and hardware interfacing (to summarize: technical environments with strong constraints).
