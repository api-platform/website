## About Hubert

After several years in a web agency, Hubert embarked on **a new adventure with SensioLabs in 2015** which led to him now being a Tech Lead.

He likes to learn as much as to pass on his knowledge. Passionate about development, especially Symfony (of course), he would love having a beard like a real geek but his facial hair refuses.

Oh, one last thing, it's name is Hubert (pronounced y.bɛʁ), **not Uber**. He won't bring you your lunch at noon!
