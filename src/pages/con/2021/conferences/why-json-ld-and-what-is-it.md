# Why JSON-LD and what is it?

From its infancy, API Platform enables developers to create JSON-LD APIs. The "-LD" part is often forgotten.

In this talk, I will walk you through **what is JSON-LD and the very much related Resource Description Framework (RDF)** and why they exist. We will discuss its importance in this growing world of data and how such formats enable interoperability and decentralisation.
