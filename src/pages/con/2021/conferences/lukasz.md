# Everything you wanted to know about Sylius, but didnâ€™t find time to ask

Sylius is **an open-source eCommerce platform** based on Symfony 4, which reached version 1.6 last September.

Is there any reason why should you check Sylius if you are not developing eCommerce websites? **What are the reasons to choose Sylius**?

For who is Sylius designed for? I will answer these questions and give some insight over the newest changes in the platform.
