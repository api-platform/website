# Symfony Runtime: wrapping API Platform in a lambda

Symfony 5.3 has released a new component named Runtime. It allows to encapsulate any PHP application in a closure, to get all the benefits of functional programming. Especially, it allows to separate the applications from global variables. Being now free of any implicit context, our applications will be able to be moved from one execution engine to another. PHP-FPM, ReactPHP, AWS Lambda, Swoole, etc.?

Let me introduce you to **a component that could become essential soon in the PHP ecosystem**. If you are interested in high performance of course!
