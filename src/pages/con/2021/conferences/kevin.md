# What's new in API Platform?

**API Platform is a popular framework to build API-driven projects**. The server component is built on top of Symfony. It enables to create modern, extensible and secure web APIs very easily: design the public data model, and that's all, you get **a fully-featured API**!

But API Platform also provides **awesome client-side components** (written in JS) working with the server component, and with any other modern REST API! These components include a smart admin builder and client generators supporting React, Vue, React Native, Next, Quasar and Vuetify! Last but not least, API Platform comes with the Docker images and the Kubernetes chart you'll need to deploy in production, in seconds.

Since its introduction during SymfonyLive Paris 2015, **API Platform evolved a lot**! It is now recognized as the easiest and most powerful set of tools to build and use new web APIs, even outside of the PHP world. During this talk, **will discover the new best practices** and the unknown gems provided by the framework.
