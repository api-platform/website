# Unified permission management between API and client

API Platform offers the possibility of creating robust and modular applications, however it is common to require a permissions system to manage users and their abilities.

I will present in this talk **my implementation to operate an advanced permissions system based on multiple criterias**, in a unified way. This allows flexible and automatic management of both the security of the API (access control for resources, automatic filters, etc.) but also the security of the client (in **Vue.js**), to control the UI and its functionalities according to the current user's rights, transparent hot reload of permissions included in case of modifications!
